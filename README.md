# 🌸 A Flower for You

Hi there hon 💐

I made this little animated flower using just HTML and CSS — simple code, but it blooms with meaning. It’s not just a project… it’s a tiny piece of my heart.

## 💌 Why I Made This
Because sometimes words aren’t enough. So I built something beautiful — for someone beautiful.

## 🧠 What’s Inside
- `index.html`: The petals and the soul
- `style.css`: The colors and the heartbeat

## 💭 Just So You Know
It’s not perfect. But it’s mine. And I made it with you in mind.

If this flower made you smile, then it was worth every line of code.
